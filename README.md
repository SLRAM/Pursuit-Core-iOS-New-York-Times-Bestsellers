# Overview

Use the NYTimes Best Sellers Books API to load a list of best selling books in a collection view. Layout should be done 100% using programmatic ui. 

- The user should be able to select different categories to view its best selling books.  
- Selecting a book should segue to a detail view controller where the user can see more information about the book and favorite the book.  
- Favoriting a book should save it to documents directory.  
- The user should be able to view all the books that they have favorited. 
- The user should be able to delete a favorited book. 
- The user should be able to use a Settings page to set the default category that will be loaded in the list of recent best sellers.
- Books added to favorites are sorted by most recently added date. 


# Detailed Outline

Your app should have (3) tabs

1. Best Sellers
2. Favorites
3. Settings

## Best Sellers

This view should have a:

- Collection View
- Picker View

The picker view should list all the available categories (Endpoint 1).  Selecting a row in the picker view should load the appropriate images in the collection view.  If the user has set a default category in the Settings tab, the picker view should spin there.

The collection view cell should include:

- The image of the books cover
- The number of weeks it has been on the best seller list
- It's description

Selecting a cell should segue to a Detail View Controller with more information including:

- The cover
- A description
- Any other relevant information you want to add as well.

## Favorites

This view should have a:

- Collection View

The collection view should display all of the books that the user has favorited. Favorites should be saved to the documents directory.

## Settings

This view should have a:

- Picker View

The user should use this picker view to set the default category for loading books.  If there is already a default set, this picker view should spin to that category.  The default category should be saved using UserDefaults and should persist between launches.
